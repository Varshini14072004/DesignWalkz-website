                                It has been a while since my last post, the longest amount of time I have ever taken away from this website actually. As much as I love illustrating architecture, I love doing other things too and sometimes there isn’t enough time to do both. Besides working digitally, I spend quite a bit of time building and doing carpentry work on my house.

                                This latest aerial image was probably my biggest undertaking up to this point in terms of difficulty of Photoshop. I struggled to get started on this illustration because I knew how complex it was going to be to stitch together all of the landscape elements.Things can get very very overwhelming and messy if you don’t stay organized and focused.

                                This has been an image that I started a while back and abandoned and then picked back up again. I wasn’t sure how I wanted to approach it because of the amount of detail involved. This view is all about the activation of the interior space and making it feel lively and interesting.I wanted the color to be the focal point, not the cloud texture.

                                Every now and then, I need to switch things up. Sometimes this means not thinking too much about what the end result will be and just seeing where things go. I needed a break from “realism” and the focus on high res textures, accurate lighting, etc. Instead, I wanted to put together a series of images that were a little more loose and playful.

                                The 46th Krob Competition has put out a call for entries. Categories include Digital/Hybrid Media, Hand Delineation, Physical Delineation, Travel Sketch, and Animation. Anybody who reads this blog knows how much of a fan I am of the unique architectural images and styles that come out of this competition.

                                I have begun a new personal visualization project to start off the winter season and help me switch things up a bit. As much as I liked working on the Texas Prairie Office, the project and scope was huge which meant every image required lots of design and time to develop the illustrations.
